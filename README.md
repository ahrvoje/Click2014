Click2014
=========

A simple clicking puzzle game implemented in HTML5 during one summer afternoon. I enjoy playing it for years, so I decided it's about time to port it to web.

The rules are simple. Just keep clicking same-colored groups until you have no choices & moves left. The ultimate goal is to clean up the board. Good luck!

Until further notice, the game is available at:
